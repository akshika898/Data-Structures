Given a linked list and a value x, partition it
such that all nodes less than x come before 
nodes greater than or equal to x

Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5

public Node partition(Node head, int x) {
        Node before_head = new Node(0);
        Node after_head = new Node(0);
        Node before = before_head , after = after_head;

        while (head != null) {

            if (head.val < x) {
                before.next = head;
                before = before.next;
            } 
            else {
                after.next = head;
                after = after.next;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        after.next = null;
        before.next = after_head.next;
        return before_head.next;
    }
}
