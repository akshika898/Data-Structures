Given array A of pos integers of size N where
each value represents no. of chocolates in a
packet. Each packet can have variable no. of
chocolates. There are M students, the task is
to distribute chocolate packets such that :
1. Each student gets one packet.
2. The diff between the no. of chocolates 
given to the students having packet with 
max chocolates and student having packet 
with min chocolates is min.

interview approach:create all possible subsets
of size m and see diff of min and max

optimized: sort and then check subarrays diff
m-sts
n-packets

static int findMin(int arr[], int n, int m)
    {
        if (m == 0 || n == 0)
            return 0;
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        if (n < m)
           return -1;
      
        int min_diff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i + m - 1 < n; i++)
        {
            int diff = arr[i+m-1] - arr[i];
            if (diff < min_diff)
                min_diff = diff;
        }
        return min_diff;
    }
