In linked lists the case is different due to 
difference in memory allocation of arrays and
linked lists. Unlike arrays, linked list nodes
may not be adjacent in memory.

Unlike array, in linked list, we can insert 
items in the middle in O(1) extra space and 
O(1) time if we are given reference/pointer
to the previous node. Therefore merge 
operation of merge sort can be implemented 
without extra space for linked lists.

In linked list to access i’th index, we have to 
travel each node from head to i’th node as
 we don’t have continuous block of 
memory. Therefore, the overhead increases 
for quick sort.
Merge sort accesses data sequentially and
the need of random access is low.
