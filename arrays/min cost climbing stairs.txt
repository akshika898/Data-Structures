On a staircase, the i-th step has some non
neg cost cost[i] assigned (0 index).
Once you pay the cost, you can either climb 
1 or 2 steps. You need to find min cost to 
reach the top of the floor and you can either 
start from the step with index 0, or the step
with index 1. 

for(int i=2;i<=cost.length-1;i++)
        cost[i]+=Math.min(cost[i-1],cost[i-2]);

return Math.min(cost[cost.length-1],cost[cost.length-2]);
