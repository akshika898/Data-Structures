It doesnâ€™t look possible to reverse a simple 
singly linked list. It can only be reversed in
O(n) time using recursive and iterative
methods.

A memory efficient doubly linked list can 
also be reversed in O(1) time by swapping 
head and tail pointers.
But we would have to traverse the list in 
forward direction using prev pointer and 
reverse direction using next pointer which 
may not be considered valid.
