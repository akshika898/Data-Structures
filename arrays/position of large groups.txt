a string s = "abbxxxxzyy" has groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z", and "yy".
 "xxxx" has the interval [3,6].
A group is considered large if it has 3 or more characters.
Return the intervals of every large group sorted in 
increasing order by start index.

Input: s = "abbxxxxzzy"
Output: [[3,6]]
Explanation: "xxxx" is the only large group with start index 3 and end index 6.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: []
Explanation: We have groups "a", "b", and "c", none of which are large groups.
